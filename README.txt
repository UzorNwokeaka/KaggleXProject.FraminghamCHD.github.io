## KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Project (Cohort 3) - Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Prediction ML Model 

A heart disease machine learning prediction model which will help identify patients at risk of coronary heart disease.

In this project, I analyzed, classified and predicted patients at risk of heart disease for a renowed US hospital using their patients biomedical dataset & various classification algorithms under supervised machine learning.

## Resources 

•	Data Source: Framingham hospital dataset as hosted on the Kaggle Platform containing 4,240 records and 16 features.

•	Python version: 3.11.4

•	Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.

## Data Cleaning

•	Converted irregularities (‘ & ‘ ‘) to NaN

•	Converted NaN values by inputting the mean values under each feature.

•	Converted education & cigsperday features from float to int data type.

So I've had the wireframe for this particular design kicking around for some time, but with all
the other interesting (and in some cases, semi-secret) projects I've been working on it took me
a little while to get to actually designing and coding it. Fortunately, things have eased up
enough for me to finaly get around to it, so I'm happy to introduce Hyperspace: a fun, blocky,
one-page design with a lot of color, a bit of animation, and an additional "generic" page template
(because hey, even one-page sites usually need an interior page or two). Hope you dig it :)
